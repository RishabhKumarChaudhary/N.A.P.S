                Envision yourself being caught in the leaping flames of a forest fire, a
                predicament no one would want to get used to. Can you visualize forested hills
                wrapped in a devil’s fiery cloak as you choke on air filled with smoke? Can you
                picture well-tended homes getting reduced to scorched concretes? Can you imagine
                the agony of families relocating to find a safer shelter? It’s seemingly
                convenient to say you don’t know, but it is much harder to commit to an actual
                low probability estimate in the face of overwhelming contrary evidence. If you
                devote some time thinking about what could threaten your livelihood, your
                thoughts would be pretty focused on significant, obvious threats- things like
                bombs and earthquakes. But with the world seemingly imploding, a global pandemic
                spreading, and world economies tanking, it is more evident than ever that we’ve
                been preparing for the wrong crisis. Climate change activists forewarned us
                about the abysmal state of our environment time and time again, but scant
                attention was paid towards the execution of corrective measures. An
                acknowledgment of these issues can help elevate the public discourse on an
                agenda of paramount significance- our planet’s future. But the sheer ignorance
                of humankind, the fact that a surging inferno in Odisha couldn’t capture the
                nation’s attention, exemplifies what happens in Similipal stays in Similipal.
                Devastating wildfires around the globe are just an annual occurrence at this
                point. Days turn to nights as fumes extinguish all the light in split seconds
                before the flaming crimson glow announces the advent of the inferno.
                Conflagrations cover the entire city with smoke. Wildfires of the kind that the
                United States and other countries witnessed in the past few years, have just
                become tempestuously real for India. A wildfire at the Similipal Biosphere
                Reserve in Odisha rampaged for over ten days, wiping out nearly a third of the
                national biosphere reserve. While the state is now reporting that the
                firefighters have eventually gained control over the fire, the source of the
                inferno is yet to be determined. The fire in this biosphere reserve coincidently
                occurred when Odisha topped the list of forest fire incidents, with 12,614 fire
                spots since 27th February, as per the reports of the Forest Survey of India.

                “It seems madness to think that a society would rate marginal economic growth
                above a livable earth, but there you are.” Bill Bryson Similipal Biosphere
                Reserve has occasionally seen fires, especially in the summer months, when a
                prolonged dry spell coupled with a sudden rise in temperature triggered forest
                fires. Located within the Mahanadian eastern coastal region of the Oriental
                Realm and the Chhotanagpur biotic province of the Deccan peninsular zone,
                Similipal is the abode to 94 species of orchids and about 3,000 species of
                plants. The distinguished species of brute creation include 12 species of
                amphibians and caecilians, 29 species of reptiles, 264 species of birds, and 42
                species of vertebrates, all of which conjointly highlight the biodiversity
                affluence of Similipal. While poachers set alight dry shrubs to drive out
                animals, villagers from the area often engage in controlled burning to enable
                better picking of the mahua flowers. So, what exactly is a controlled burn? A
                controlled burn is a wildfire that the inhabitants set deliberately for a
                specific purpose. According to WWF, well-thought-out and well-managed controlled
                burns can be profitable, especially for forest management, as they can help stop
                an out-of-control wildfire. But this doesn’t mean all calculated wildfires are
                good; some are far from it. Innumerable fires deliberately set for agriculture
                and land clearing are at best half-baked, and at worst calamitous. Slash and
                burn fires are placed every day to destroy large sections of forests.
                Undoubtedly, these forest fires remove trees and kill and displace wildlife,
                alter water cycles and soil fertility, and threaten the inhabitants’ lives and
                livelihoods. In 1997, wildfires set intentionally to clear the grasslands in
                Indonesia intensified into one of the largest wildfires chronicled in history.
                Hundreds of people died, millions of acres burned, endangered species like
                orangutans perished, smoke and ash haze hung over Southeast Asia for months,
                curtailing visibility and resulting in acute health risks. To minimize that
                threat as much as possible, controlled burns must be well-considered,
                well-planned, and ignited, and maintained by schooled specialists. But the crux
                and nitty-gritty of this scenario? Fire can be a gizmo for conservation, but
                only when used appropriately. Fortunately, thanks to rainfall and hailstorm at
                the Pithabata range, the fire has been finally contained after raging for the
                past two weeks.
