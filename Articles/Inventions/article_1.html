                                    Since the outbreak of COVID- 19 pandemic, the world was struggling hard to develop
                                    the vaccine as soon as possible. Just one year back, in 2020, we were waiting for
                                    the vaccines, and today the world is having more than 10 types of doses where India
                                    is setting landmarks by administering the second highest number of jabs in the
                                    world. India has developed two vaccines on its own, naming COVAXIN by Bharat Biotech
                                    and Covishield by Serum Institute of India earlier in July 2020. Today, the country
                                    is not only vaccinating its own citizens but has also exported the doses to the
                                    international market. We are expecting to vaccinate our 137 crore people by the end
                                    of 2021 where on the other hand clinical trials for vaccines for below 18 years age
                                    group is already on the go. Let’s know how India developed its own vaccines in no
                                    time.

                                            COVAXIN, India's indigenous COVID-19 vaccine by Bharat Biotech is developed in
                                            collaboration with the Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR) - National
                                            Institute of Virology (NIV). The indigenous, inactivated vaccine is developed and
                                            manufactured in Bharat Biotech's BSL-3 (Bio-Safety Level 3) high containment

                                    COVAXIN is included along with immune-potentiators, also known as vaccine
                                    adjuvants, which are added to the vaccine to increase and boost its immunogenicity.
                                    It is a 2-dose vaccination regimen given 28 days apart. It is a vaccine with no
                                    sub-zero storage, no reconstitution requirement, and ready to use liquid
                                    presentation in multi-dose vials, stable at 2-8oC. The vaccine received DCGI
                                    approval for Phase I & II Human Clinical Trials in July, 2020.

                                    A total of 375 subjects have been enrolled in the Phase 1 study and generated
                                    excellent safety data without any reactogenicity. Vaccine-induced neutralizing
                                    antibody titers were observed with two divergent SARS-CoV-2 strains. Percentage of
                                    all the side-effects combined was only 15% in vaccine recipients. In Phase 2 study,
                                    380 participants of 12-65 years were enrolled. COVAXIN led to tolerable safety
                                    outcomes and enhanced humoral and cell-mediated immune responses. A total of 25,800
                                    subjects have been enrolled and randomized in a 1:1 ratio to receive the vaccine and
                                    control in an Event-Driven, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled,
                                    multicentre phase 3 study. The purpose of this study is to evaluate the efficacy,
                                    safety, and immunogenicity of COVAXIN® in volunteers aged ≥18 years. COVAXIN
                                    demonstrated 78% vaccine efficacy against mild, moderate, and severe COVID-19
                                    disease. The efficacy against severe COVID-19 disease was 100% with an impact on
                                    reduction in hospitalizations.
                                    Bharat biotech has been approached by several countries across the world for the
                                    procurement of COVAXIN. Clinical trials in other countries will commence soon.
                                    Supplies from government to government in the following countries to take place:
                                    Mongolia, Myanmar, Sri Lanka, Philippines, Bahrain, Oman, Maldives and Mauritius.

                                    Not only this, today India is producing crores of COVAXIN doses every month. Also,
                                    Oxford-AstraZeneca made Covishield by genetically engineering adenovirus that
                                    normally infects chimpanzees. It uses double-stranded DNA and has been developed by
                                    Serum Institute of India (SII) with efficiency of more than 70%.
