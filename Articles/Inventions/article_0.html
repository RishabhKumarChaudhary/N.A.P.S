                                    In history, many people have come up with several inventions in the aim of making
                                    the lives of human beings better and comfortable. As life continues, different
                                    inventions are changing at the same rate as the changing world. “Necessity is the
                                    mother of invention.” This quote is commonly used to explain how various miraculous
                                    inventions were discovered. Throughout history, many inventions have been created.
                                    The Industrial Revolution started in the late 1700s, and since then human beings
                                    have been developing at an exponential rate. Truly amazing and useful devices, such
                                    as the steam engine and telegraph, were invented. In the last 100 years, many
                                    inventions and innovations have been created that make society’s life better, and
                                    four devices stand out as the most useful: the jet airplane, the television, the
                                    laptop computer, and the cell phone.
<br><br>
                                    The first most useful invention is the airplane, invented in 1903 by the Wright
                                    brothers. The airplane has transformed not only this society, but also the entire
                                    world. Airplanes make it possible to travel long distances in a few hours, whereas
                                    before it took days or weeks to travel by horseback. In fact, a plane enables people
                                    to travel over high mountains and deep oceans with ease. It is as if the Atlantic
                                    and Pacific Oceans were small rivers and the Himalaya and Rocky Mountains were tiny
                                    hills to jump over. In addition, with the invention of the plane, the world is
                                    smaller because a person can now effortlessly travel from one country to another to
                                    work, study, or take vacations.
                                    <br><br>
                                    The second most important invention in the last century is the computer, and
                                    specifically the laptop computer with an internet connection. The computer was
                                    invented in the mid-1900s, but in the 1980s the personal computer transformed how
                                    people use it. Because a laptop computer is small, portable, and can store large
                                    amounts of data, it is useful for business and study. From email to ecommerce and
                                    from ebooks to downloading movies and games, the personal computer has transformed
                                    everyone’s life. Computer software programs make it possible to keep track not only
                                    of business accounting and inventory, but also to buy and sell online. The Internet
                                    connects computers with a network of websites, and people can communicate on the
                                    computer with email, blogs, wikis, and even phone conversations.
                                    <br><br>
                                    This leads into the third most useful invention, the cell phone. Popularized in the
                                    1990s, the cell phone keeps people safer and more connected. People can talk or send
                                    text messages to friends and family when they are far away, even in another country.
                                    Other examples of the cell phone’s usefulness are that drivers can call to let
                                    someone know they will be delayed if they get stuck in traffic or call for help if
                                    their car breaks down. In addition, phones often have Internet browsers, so people
                                    can stay up-to-date with news and events. Also, with camera phones people can take
                                    and share pictures of friends and family easily.
<br><br>
                                    The fourth most useful invention is the television. With many channels to choose
                                    from, and literally thousands of programs, the learning possibilities are endless.
                                    Although not all programs are educational, many programs are, and people can learn
                                    encyclopaedia worth of knowledge and information. News is available 24 hours a day,
                                    so when important events happen in another part of the world, people can find out
                                    easily. This is in contrast to the past when it took days, months, or even years to
                                    find out the news from faraway places. Also, comedy and dramatic shows let us enjoy
                                    the funny moments in life and deal more effectively with the serious ones.
<br><br>
                                    In conclusion, the airplane, television, laptop computer and cell phone are all
                                    useful inventions. Although there are many inventions to choose from, these four
                                    have dramatically transformed the world. All these inventions are connecting people
                                    to other people, places, and ideas. It will be interesting to see what is invented
                                    in the future!
