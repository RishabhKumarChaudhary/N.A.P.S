                                    friends and loved ones, online streaming platforms such as Netflix, Amazon Prime
                                    etc. didn’t let us feel bored and are constantly coming with amazing contents. We do

                                    The show focuses on a group of young men who want to take the Union Public Service
                                    Commission (UPSC) examinations and have only dream of becoming an IAS officer and
                                    serving the nation. The premise of the show is divided into the past and present,
                                    which offers a glimpse into the characters’ lives. Naveen Kasturia plays the lead
                                    role of a man whose desperation for cracking UPSC forces him to make several
                                    personal and professional sacrifices. It’s one of those shows that will motivate you
                                    to keep believing in yourself even if there’s no end in sight.

                                    Jitendra Kumar plays the role of Abhishek, an engineering graduate who would rather
                                    prepare for his CAT exams than
                                    take up the job of a secretary at a village panchayat office. However, when he does
                                    start working at the humble
                                    government office, his perception about village life slowly changes. The show
                                    doesn’t try to preach, instead subtly
                                    alludes to the fact that you can find hope even when you think you have hit rock
                                    bottom.
