                                    There is more to life than is dreamt of in human philosophy: there is also the paranormal. If you have the necessarily strong disposition for it, ghost hunting can give you a closer insight into human history and behaviour. We can’t deny the fact that there are such incidents in the past that make us think if ghosts exist or not.

                                    This is a fact that if there’s day then there’s night too, similarly if there are positive energies around us then there are negative energies too. Sometimes some people may experience it and consider them as ghosts or other paranormal stuff. Today we are going to make you meet those people who have seen ghosts in real life. The most amazing fact is that they are not ordinary people but our favourite celebrities!  The truth is out there!
                                    Kristen Stewart
                                    In a 2019 chat with Vanity Fair, the actress opened up about her beliefs.
                                    <div class="img-container" style="display: flex; justify-content: center; align-items: center; margin:2rem 0">

                                    “I talk to them,” Stewart said of ghosts. “If I’m in a weird, small town, making a movie, and I’m in a strange apartment, I will literally be like, ‘No, please, I cannot deal. Anyone else, but it cannot be me.’ Who knows what ghosts are, but there is an energy that I’m really sensitive to. Not just with ghosts, but with people. People stain rooms all the time.”
                                    Lily Collins
                                    The Extremely Wicked, Shockingly Evil and Vile star believes she received some support from the ghosts of Ted Bundy's victims while preparing to take on the role of the infamous serial killer's ex-girlfriend Elizabeth Kloepfer.

                                    She told The Guardian that she was "woken up by flashes of images, like the aftermath of a struggle" every night at 3:05 a.m. while filming. "I discovered that 3 a.m. is the time when the veil between the realms is the thinnest and one can be visited," Collins told the outlet. "I didn’t feel scared. I felt supported. I felt like people were saying, 'We’re here listening. We’re here to support. Thank you for telling the story.' "

                                    Reeves claims that he saw a ghost as a child living in New York City. "I'm probably like 6, 7 years old, we'd come from Australia. Renata, [our] nanny, in the bedroom, my sister is asleep, she's sitting over there, I'm hanging out. There was a doorway and all of a sudden this jacket came waving through the doorway, this empty jacket — there's no body, there's no legs, it's just there. And then it disappears," he explained on Jimmy Kimmel Live!. "I was a little kid and I thought, 'Okay, that's interesting,' and I looked over at the nanny and she [was making this terrified face]. And I'm like 'Oh wow, so that was real.'"

                                    While doing press for his 2009 movie Ghosts of Girlfriends Past, McConaughey shared that his Hollywood home was haunted by a spirit named Madame Bleu. "I was not even under the influence and she was there. She wasn't that happy, it didn't seem like she was going to be much fun to hang around or have in my house, so I went ahead and stood my ground. I opened the door and said 'You can move around all you want but I'm not going anywhere.' For weeks everyone that came to the house said the same thing: 'There's someone down in that hall, there's somebody down in that hall.'" The actor went on to say that eventually he stopped getting visits from Madame Bleu and his guests fell in love with her former favorite room.

                                    The "Hands to Myself" singer confessed to her paranormal believer status during a 2015 visit to The Tonight Show. "I believe in ghosts, so I have a ghost app … I believe that spirits can tap into technology. Why not, right?" she told host Jimmy Fallon. According to Gomez, the app has detected otherworldly presences around her in the past: "Look, I was in a venue and it actually said people in my life by name."
